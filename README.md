|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | sbp | Input | Systolic Blood Pressure |
| 2 | tobacco | Input | Cumulative Tobacco (kg) |
| 3 | ldl | Input | Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol |
| 4 | adiposity | Input | Adiposity |
| 5 | famhist | Input | Family history of heart disease (Present, Absent) |
| 6 | typea | Input | Type-A behavior |
| 7 | obesity | Input | Obesity |
| 8 | alcohol | Input | Current alcohol consumption |
| 9 | age | Input | Age at onset |
| 10 | chd | Target | Coronary heart disease (Yes, No) |
